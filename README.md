# ONS_OSS - Object Naming Scenes Assessment Engine

## Project Overview

**ONS_OSS** (Object Naming Scenes - Open Source Software) is a set of Unity-based cognitive assessment games designed to be embedded within Flutter applications. The project provides voice-based assessment tasks where users describe visual scenes and stories, enabling evaluation of language production and cognitive abilities.

### Licence
The code and assets in this repository are released under the MIT License as required by the Fab Inc. grant agreement.
Certain components of the Trackosaurus platform (including non-federated Unity assets, the AWS backend, and Flutter front end) are proprietary and excluded from this license.

### Game Description
The application presents users with animated visual scenarios and prompts them to describe what they see. Each assessment consists of carefully designed scenes with accompanying video animations that tell short stories, requiring verbal responses from participants.

### Target Platforms

- **Android**: API Level 22+ (Android 5.1 / Lollipop)

### Unity Version
- **Unity 2022.3.62f2 LTS**

### Key Features
- **Voice Assessment Tasks (VAD)**: Four distinct visual assessment scenarios with video animations
  - Scene 1: Nest
  - Scene 2: Green Dress Story
  - Scene 3: Cats
  - Scene 4: Paw Prints
- **Flutter Integration**: Seamless Unity-Flutter communication for session management and data submission
- **Tutorial System**: "Explainer" system with animated character guidance
- **Analytics & Data Submission**: Real-time submission of assessment results to backend via Flutter
- **Service-Based Architecture**: Modular, ScriptableObject-based service system
- **Custom Animation System**: Lightweight tween animation framework

---

## Technical Architecture

### Core Systems

#### 1. **ServiceAsset Pattern**
A custom service architecture (Assets/_/Scripts/Core/Service/ServiceAsset.cs:8) provides:
- ScriptableObject-based services with automatic initialization
- Persistent services across scenes (`DontDestroyOnLoad`)
- Async initialization with lifecycle management
- Examples: `PlaySessionService`, `LoadingScreenService`, `UserProfileService`

#### 2. **PlaySession Management**
The `PlaySessionService` (Assets/_/Scripts/Core/PlaySession/PlaySessionService.cs:12) orchestrates game flow:
- Queue-based assessment task system
- Scene loading and unloading
- Loading screen management during transitions
- Data submission to Flutter via `UnityMessageManager`

#### 3. **Event System**
ScriptableObject-based event system (Assets/_/Scripts/Core/Event/GameEvent.cs:9):
- Asset-based events for cross-scene communication
- Observer pattern with subscribe/unsubscribe functionality
- Runtime-safe (Editor-only execution prevention)

#### 4. **Flutter Integration**
Bidirectional Unity-Flutter communication:
- `FlutterIntegration` component for initialization
- `UnityMessageManager` for message passing
- `TrackosaurusAPI` for result submission
- JSON serialization via Newtonsoft.Json

#### 5. **Analytics & Data Submission**
- `VADAnalytics` tracks assessment events
- `TrackosaurusAPI` submits results with session metadata
- Real-time data transmission to Flutter host app
- Structured payload format for backend processing

#### 6. **Tween Animation System**
Custom lightweight animation components:
- `TweenPosition`, `TweenRotation`, `TweenScale`
- `TweenImageColor`, `TweenSpriteColor`
- Custom easing functions via `Easing` class

### Assembly Definitions

| Assembly | Purpose | Key Dependencies |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| `BirdTracks.Game.Core` | Core game systems, services, UI, analytics | FlutterUnityIntegration, Unity.Linq, TextMeshPro |
| `Birdtracks.Game.ONS` | Voice assessment task implementation | Core, Sweet.uTility, Cinemachine, Timeline |
| `FlutterUnityIntegration` | Unity-Flutter bridge | Newtonsoft.Json |
| `Sweet.uTility` | Coroutine management utilities | - |
| `Unity.Linq` | GameObject LINQ query library | - |

### Design Patterns

- **Singleton**: ServiceAsset instances (e.g., `PlaySessionService.Instance`)
- **Observer**: GameEvent system for decoupled communication
- **Service Locator**: ServiceAsset pattern for accessing services
- **Queue**: PlaySessionService uses queues for task management
- **Component**: MonoBehaviour-based task logic

## Development Notes

### Coding Conventions

- **Namespace**: All core code uses `BirdTracks.Game.Core`, voice tasks use `Birdtracks.Game.ONS`
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Private fields: `_camelCase` with underscore prefix
  - Public properties: `PascalCase`
  - Local variables: `camelCase`
  - Methods: `PascalCase`
- **ScriptableObjects**: Used extensively for data, configuration, and services
- **Assembly Definitions**: Keep code modular; new scripts must be in appropriate assembly folders

### Testing the Game

#### In Unity Editor:

1. Open `Assets/_/Content/Core/Scenes/DebugPanel.unity`
2. Press **Play** in the Unity Editor
3. The game initializes with test `FlutterInitArgs` (configured in scene)
4. Use debug UI to navigate between assessment scenes
5. Press **T** key (if configured) to reinitialize

#### Testing Flutter Integration:

1. Build Unity as a library/module for Flutter
2. Run within Flutter app context with actual session data
3. Monitor Unity-Flutter messaging via Flutter DevTools
4. Verify result submissions reach backend

### Important Gotchas

#### 1. **Flutter Initialization Required**
- Unity expects `FlutterInitArgs` JSON on startup via `FlutterIntegration.Init()`
- In Editor mode, test arguments are provided automatically
- In production, Flutter **must** call this with real session data

#### 2. **ServiceAsset Lifecycle**
- ServiceAssets auto-initialize when enabled in play mode
- They persist across scenes using `DontDestroyOnLoad`
- Do not instantiate multiple instances; use singleton pattern

#### 3. **Scene Management**
- Main entry point: `SampleScene.unity`
- Assessment scenes loaded additively by `PlaySessionService`
- Empty scene used for cleanup between tasks

#### 4. **Assembly References**
- Scripts in different assemblies require `.asmdef` references
- Cannot create circular assembly dependencies
- New scripts must be in correct assembly folder or won't compile

#### 5. **Editor vs. Build Behavior**
- Many systems check `#if UNITY_EDITOR` for Editor-specific behavior
- Flutter messaging disabled in Editor mode
- Some features only work in device builds

#### 6. **Video Playback**
- Videos stored in `StreamingAssets` for runtime access
- Use `Application.streamingAssetsPath` to load
- Test on actual devices as performance varies

#### 7. **Analytics & Data Submission**
- All results submitted via `TrackosaurusAPI.SubmitStoryGameResult()`
- Data passed to Flutter via `UnityMessageManager`
- Only functions in builds (disabled in Editor)

### Debugging Tips

- **Unity Console**: Monitor errors, warnings, and logs during play
- **Flutter DevTools**: Inspect Unity-Flutter message passing
- **Unity Profiler**: Analyze performance (**Window → Analysis → Profiler**)
- **LogAsset**: Configure per-system logging levels (see `Log.Default.asset`)
- **Debug Panel Scene**: Use for testing individual systems

### Performance Considerations

- **2D Rendering**: Lightweight sprite-based rendering
- **Custom Tweens**: No external animation library overhead
- **ScriptableObjects**: Reduce runtime memory allocations
- **Streaming Assets**: Videos loaded on-demand to manage memory
- **IL2CPP**: Recommended for production builds (better performance)
